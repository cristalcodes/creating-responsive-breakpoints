Hello!

This small lab is a part of Skillcrush's Front End Developer Blueprint.

In this lesson, we're developing with a mobile-first approach. The goal of the lab is to set two media breakpoints: one for tablets and one for desktops, seeking only to change the color of the background at each width.

Lesson learned: it is better to design with a mobile first approach, and then only create media-breakpoints for certain widths, as opposed to creating breakpoints for every possible device due to constant device releases!
